# Jokenpô (Rock, Paper, Scissors)

A simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game developed in Python 🐍.  
This was my first project while learning programming — created to practice conditionals, functions, and user interaction via terminal.

## 🎮 How it works

- The player is asked to choose between rock, paper, or scissors.
- The computer randomly selects one of the three options.
- A countdown ("JO-KEN-PÔ!") is printed before revealing the result.
- The result (win, lose, or draw) is shown with a fun and colorful message.

## 🧠 Concepts practiced

- Conditionals (`if/elif/else`)
- Loops (`while`)
- Functions and return values
- Tuples
- Input validation
- Colored terminal output using ANSI escape codes
- Random choices with the `random` module
- Timing with `sleep()` from the `time` module

## 🚀 How to run the game

Make sure you have **Python 3** installed. Then run:

```bash
python jokenpo.py


Made with 💜 by Yumi Mendes while learning Python.
This is my first public repository. I hope it helps or inspires someone else who’s learning too!


ps.: This game was originally made in Portuguese 🇧🇷, but I translated most of it to english.
